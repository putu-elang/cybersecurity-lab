# üîµ SSH Brute Force Detection Lab

## üìñ Overview
This lab demonstrates how Wazuh detects a simulated SSH brute force attack.  
The configuration was **left at default (no ossec.conf modifications)** to test what Wazuh can catch out of the box.

---

## ‚ö° Attack Scenario
- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux  
- **Target Machine**: Ubuntu Agent (monitored by Wazuh Manager)  
- **Manager**: Ubuntu Server  
- **SIEM Tool**: Wazuh  
- **Attack Tool**: Hydra  
- **Attack Goal**: Crack SSH credentials by brute forcing passwords  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Documentation
- Wazuh SIEM detected **3,592 authentication failures** on the Ubuntu Agent.

- Wazuh logs confirm that the targeted machine was the **Ubuntu Agent**, and multiple rules were triggered.

### ‚úÖ Triggered Rules
1. **Rule 2502** ‚Äì Password authentication failed more than once.

2. **Rule 5710** ‚Äì Attempted SSH login into a nonexistent user.

3. **Rule 5758** ‚Äì Maximum authentication attempts reached.

## üìå Lessons Learned
1. The attack triggered multiple Wazuh rules by default, showing SIEM strength.
2. Useful MITRE ATT&CK mapping: T1110 ‚Äì Brute Force.
3. An active defense strategy could include auto-blocking IPs after repeated failures.
